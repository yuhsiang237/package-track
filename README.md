# Package Track

A frontend package version tracking tool that helps teams quickly monitor dependency status and update dynamics.

## Introduction

In current team development workflows, frontend engineers need to manually check package version updates, leading to fragmented and time-consuming processes that cause:

- Difficulty keeping track of major updates (e.g., React, Vue3, Next.js, SASS, Angular, etc.)
- Lack of unified version viewing mechanism, causing potential security and compatibility issues from outdated packages

To solve these problems, we have designed a "Frontend Package Version Tracking Tool" to help teams quickly grasp the status of dependency packages.

## Key Features

### Centralized Package Viewing
- Unified display of all project dependency package version information
- Support for importing package.json files in various formats
- Clear interface showing current and latest versions

### Real-time Update Tracking
- Automatic checking of available package updates
- Detailed version difference information
- Filtering and sorting functionality to quickly find packages needing updates

### Enhanced Security and Compatibility
- Security warning information display
- Compatibility issue identification from outdated versions
- Update recommendations and best practices

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Nuxt 4](https://nuxt.com/) - Vue.js Framework
